# Challenges faced
## Part 1
I encountered an error arising from float-point representation and accumulation when calculating the absolute difference. 
The discrepancy was making my answer rise too high. I think this mathematical issue is Golang based. I have noticed it occurs when performing math using floats.
At a point I used excel to calculate the differences ðŸ˜„ and compare the output to my code.
